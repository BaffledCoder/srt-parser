<b>Happy birthday, </b><i>Little
 Deedee.</i>

2
00:03:53,779 --> 00:03:55,904
{\a9}Dad!

00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:16,836
{\an5}<font color="dark-brown">Pray for the soul of the deceased,
<b>Theodore Joseph Logan.</b></font>

4
00:04:56,234 --> 00:04:59,334
<i>Daniella, </i><b>are you alright, </b>dear?

5
00:05:07,148 --> 00:05:12,123
- I thought maybe you needed something.
- I'm fine, thanks.

6
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:15,915
- Let's go and join the others.
- Yes.

7
00:05:19,773 --> 00:05:23,290
<b><i>Contrary to what people are led to
believe, in the final analysis, Raymond,</i></b>

8
00:05:24,232 --> 00:05:29,123
<font color="white">women are much stronger
than we are.</font>

9
00:05:29,732 --> 00:05:33,496
Take childbirth, for example.
No man could endure it.

10
00:05:34,105 --> 00:05:38,371
And yet they have a hidden strength,
they're programmed for it.

11
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:41,121
- lf you will excuse me, doctor.
- By the way, I read this article.

12
00:05:58,394 --> 00:05:59,478
Are you okay?

13
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:03,869
Would you like to come
and stay at our house tonight?

14
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:09,119
<font color="white"><b>No. Thank you.</b> I think I'll be
alright for tonight.</font>

15
00:06:10,894 --> 00:06:15,161
But I'm glad I've sold the house.
I can't bear to be there alone.

16
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:21,111
And you, instead of worrying about
everybody else,

17
00:06:21,311 --> 00:06:23,703
you should go and get some rest.

18
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:27,117
The baby kicks a lot.

19
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:29,901
But worse is boring Doctor Larabee.

20
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:32,367
He's been giving me advice
all afternoon.

21
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:36,451
In his expert opinion,
I'm "programmed to deliver".

22
00:06:39,476 --> 00:06:41,559
Here he comes, now.

23
00:06:43,476 --> 00:06:46,451
Got to go fetch Raymond.
I'm exhausted.

24
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:48,817
How are you feeling, Daniella?

25
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:50,017
All right.

26
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:53,657
But those tests you're doing
on me are very tiring.

27
00:06:53,974 --> 00:06:58,032
Well, the thing is we've started so
we should go through with it.

28
00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:02,115
- Are you experiencing any pain?
- Only sometimes.

29
00:07:02,515 --> 00:07:06,782
Keep taking the pills and
double the dose, if necessary.

30
00:07:07,724 --> 00:07:09,907
When will you get the results?
- Soon.

31
00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:11,932
A couple of days.

32
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:36,930
Daniella.

33
00:07:37,972 --> 00:07:40,738
Now the worst part begins, Simon.

34
00:07:41,472 --> 00:07:43,097
His absence.

35
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:45,488
I know, sweetheart. I know.

36
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,595
But you'll move on.

37
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,611
You're strong, like him.

38
00:07:54,886 --> 00:07:57,945
Daniella, there's something
we have to talk about.

39
00:07:58,261 --> 00:08:00,653
Your mother will have to be told
what has happened.

40
00:08:01,345 --> 00:08:03,986
If you want me to, I'll do it.

41
00:08:04,803 --> 00:08:05,928
No.

42
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,970
No, thank you.

43
00:08:10,386 --> 00:08:13,153
But this is something
I have to do myself.

44
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:19,026
I don't know how I'm going
to break it to her, but I will.

45
00:08:22,051 --> 00:08:24,109
I'm leaving now.
I've got some work to do.

46
00:08:24,843 --> 00:08:27,093
But today?

47
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:30,484
A lot of the larvae
are ready to open.

48
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:38,093
Mind yourself.

49
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:45,441
- Mr. Hastings?
- Hastings, yes, that's me.

50
00:08:46,716 --> 00:08:49,232
This is it, bring the stuff in.

51
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:54,316
- But, what stuff?
- I'd almost forgotten.

52
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:57,524
I bought them the other day,
for Chrysteen and the baby.

53
00:08:58,132 --> 00:09:00,724
I know that you've decided that
the baby will be born at home,

54
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:02,891
so I took the liberty.

55
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:07,107
I hope you don't mind.
I wanted to be the one to buy them.

56
00:09:07,424 --> 00:09:10,189
Of course not.
How could I mind?

57
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:14,297
Thank you.

58
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:18,022
- Goodbye, Simon
- Goodbye.

59
00:09:24,714 --> 00:09:25,964
Day one.

60
00:09:26,922 --> 00:09:28,797
Sample RBK-72.

61
00:09:30,214 --> 00:09:32,897
Environment sterilisation
confirmed.

62
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,437
Temperature stabilised at 32Â°.

63
00:09:42,878 --> 00:09:45,587
78% humidity.

64
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,712
Daniella,

65
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:03,395
Iook at the camera, love.
Go on.

66
00:10:06,293 --> 00:10:10,018
Wave to Daddy. Hello! Look!
Mummy's got the camera.

67
00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:17,310
Look at me love, go on.
Love, don't be shy.

68
00:10:18,168 --> 00:10:18,793
Go on.

69
00:10:20,335 --> 00:10:23,893
Smile! Don't be shy, silly!

70
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,351
Today's your birthday.
You're eight,

71
00:10:29,918 --> 00:10:32,476
a year for every rose
in this bunch.

72
00:10:33,124 --> 00:10:34,799
I can't be there with you.

73
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:38,766
But someone will see that you
get this at the right time.

74
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,516
Inside you'll find your present.

75
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,641
A always, always,
wherever I may be,

76
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,266
Happy birthday, little Deedee.

77
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:00,431
Always, wherever I may be,

78
00:11:01,747 --> 00:11:04,014
happy birthday, little Deedee.

79
00:11:51,704 --> 00:11:54,512
- Good morning, Miss Logan.
- Good morning.

80
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,202
Thank you.

81
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:04,260
- Daniella?
- Hello.

82
00:12:04,743 --> 00:12:05,827
Good morning.

83
00:12:06,243 --> 00:12:08,552
How has she been this week?

84
00:12:09,368 --> 00:12:11,718
No change.
More or less the same.

85
00:12:12,368 --> 00:12:16,260
I have to tell her
what's happened. I'm afraid...

86
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,343
She's so fragile.
What do you think?

87
00:12:21,118 --> 00:12:24,508
To be quite honest, I don't think
she'll understand.

88
00:12:27,033 --> 00:12:30,508
- lf you need me, I'll be in my office.
- Thank you, Doctor.

89
00:12:37,616 --> 00:12:41,925
He takes our orange marmalade away!
Fucking Doctor Grant!

90
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:10,406
Hello, Mum.

91
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:18,571
How are you today?

92
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,754
The doctor tells me
you've had a good week.

93
00:13:43,654 --> 00:13:45,087
There's something I have to tell you.

94
00:13:52,152 --> 00:13:54,585
Something terrible has happened.

95
00:14:02,194 --> 00:14:03,610
Dad is dead.

96
00:14:11,694 --> 00:14:14,417
I wanted to be the one to tell you.

97
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:25,208
Fucking Doctor Grant.
He's broken the little house.

98
00:14:26,192 --> 00:14:28,792
He breaks everything.
Fucking Doctor Grant!

99
00:14:32,817 --> 00:14:33,858
Josephine?

100
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:44,398
You spoke.

101
00:14:46,106 --> 00:14:48,998
- I heard you.
- Josephine?

102
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:53,648
It's me. Daniella,

103
00:14:53,815 --> 00:14:55,023
your daughter.

104
00:14:56,106 --> 00:14:56,981
Josephine?

105
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,773
josephine!

106
00:15:03,523 --> 00:15:05,456
It's me. Who's josephine?

107
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:16,788
Just step aside. She's very agitated.

108
00:15:17,229 --> 00:15:18,188
Just step aside.

109
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:30,163
Fucking Doctor Grant!
Fucking Doctor Grant!

110
00:15:33,104 --> 00:15:35,188
"josephine"?

111
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,019
I'm sorry but...

112
00:15:40,477 --> 00:15:42,994
should it mean something to me?

113
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:47,577
I thought it might be the name
of a nurse, or another patient.

114
00:15:49,727 --> 00:15:52,036
Someone she might be friends with.

115
00:15:53,311 --> 00:15:55,494
Forgive me for being so blunt,

116
00:15:55,811 --> 00:16:00,036
but as you well know, your mother
has no contact with anyone at all.

117
00:16:03,892 --> 00:16:06,200
Maybe this is a good sign.

118
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,825
In all these years your mother has
never reacted to any external stimulus.

119
00:16:13,017 --> 00:16:15,742
This could give us
some cause for hope.

120
00:16:17,225 --> 00:16:21,159
Perhaps the shock produced
by the death of your father

121
00:16:21,725 --> 00:16:24,325
will help her start to react.

122
00:16:42,807 --> 00:16:46,990
I've always had this feeling that
he only lived to make me happy.

123
00:16:49,515 --> 00:16:53,282
I just don't understand how
he could do this to me.

124
00:16:54,307 --> 00:16:57,948
It's as if he's abandoned me,
and I need to know why.

125
00:16:58,263 --> 00:17:02,030
What could have possibly happened
to make him do such a thing?

126
00:17:04,305 --> 00:17:07,113
He always seemed like
such a serious man to me.

127
00:17:07,805 --> 00:17:10,530
It was as if he found it
difficult to smile.

128
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:14,196
There was a sadness about him.

129
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:18,238
Because of what happened to Mum.

130
00:17:19,055 --> 00:17:21,696
Maybe that is why we were so close.

131
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,194
For my last birthday
he gave me a butterfly.

132
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:32,486
A new undiscovered species.

133
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:37,194
Scientists were still discovering
new species in Africa and the Amazon.

134
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:41,236
He had one ordered
from an entomologist,

135
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:44,819
and he sent it to me,

136
00:17:45,344 --> 00:17:49,194
hidden in a bunch of
twenty-four red roses.

137
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,153
We named it together:.

138
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:57,109
"The Green Logan Butterfly".

139
00:17:57,426 --> 00:18:01,067
- You're joking.
- No, seriously.

140
00:18:07,134 --> 00:18:09,859
He won't be here for this birthday.

141
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:14,342
No more roses.

142
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:26,774
- Your jaw still troubling you?
- Yes. I need a vacation.

143
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:30,424
Take it easy.

144
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,397
Isn't it a bit late for a fellow
like you to be out all alone?

145
00:18:59,088 --> 00:19:01,980
I've got all the company
I want, thanks.

146
00:19:02,297 --> 00:19:03,338
Okay.

147
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:27,561
Good night, Chrysteen.

148
00:19:28,295 --> 00:19:31,811
- And goodnight, Gabriel.
- Or Gabriella.

149
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,811
We'll have to wait and see.

150
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:39,103
It'll be a boy, you'll see.
I have a feeling it will.

151
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:48,268
Here, take this. I want him to
have something of mine.

152
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:56,684
- No, leave the light on please.
- Okay. Good night.

153
00:21:17,745 --> 00:21:18,995
Agent.

154
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:24,428
Miss Logan, isn't it?

155
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:29,637
I am lnspector Potts,
in charge of this case.

156
00:21:31,453 --> 00:21:35,593
Nobody has seen anything,
there are no traces of any kind.

157
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:40,385
We are looking for them. This really is
a very peculiar occurrence.

158
00:21:42,076 --> 00:21:42,951
Why?

159
00:21:44,451 --> 00:21:46,951
Can you tell me why?

160
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,593
I don't know, Miss,
I've no explanation for this.

161
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:56,093
We are questioning the watchman,

162
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,968
but it seems he fell asleep watching
some television programme.

163
00:22:00,493 --> 00:22:04,258
- So, what are you going to do now?
- Do? Regarding what?

164
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:06,741
Regarding what?

165
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:09,341
Regarding this of course.

166
00:22:09,658 --> 00:22:13,049
Somebody has dug up my father's body
and has stolen it.

167
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:16,299
What's more, they've made absolutely
sure we'd know they've done it.

168
00:22:16,616 --> 00:22:19,424
You wouldn't believe the strange
things we see in this job!

169
00:22:19,741 --> 00:22:24,174
Probably the work of a bunch of kids.
Listen to heavy metal backwards and...

170
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:27,716
Children? Are you serious?

171
00:22:30,406 --> 00:22:34,297
Sorry, I must be going. I'll keep you
informed of whatever we find out.

172
00:22:35,947 --> 00:22:40,214
Shit! Boys, this cup isn't a clue.
I've just left it here myself.

173
00:22:42,822 --> 00:22:44,947
That's it?

174
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:49,839
- You're just leaving like that?
- I'll keep you informed.

175
00:22:55,781 --> 00:22:58,754
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
I'll take them home for the missus.

176
00:24:00,525 --> 00:24:03,191
Yes, oh, yes.

177
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,900
Come on, kill him.

178
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:14,625
Excuse me.
I am looking for a man.

179
00:24:15,691 --> 00:24:18,956
That's nothing new.
You'll get over it in time.

180
00:24:19,273 --> 00:24:20,439
He's my father.

181
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:28,123
Yes, he was here.
A real gentleman.

182
00:24:28,731 --> 00:24:33,414
- Was he staying here?
- A smart man like him? Not likely!

183
00:24:33,731 --> 00:24:37,956
He came to visit a friend. I can't think
what they've got in common, though.

184
00:24:38,606 --> 00:24:42,873
That bloke, that friend of his,
it gives you the creeps to look at him.

185
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:45,706
Still, he paid a full month
in advance.

186
00:24:46,023 --> 00:24:49,787
He's upstairs, in room 26.
He's out at the moment though.

187
00:24:50,687 --> 00:24:54,787
- Could it be a man called Harris?
- Yes, Harris.

188
00:24:55,646 --> 00:24:57,021
Toby Harris.

189
00:24:57,771 --> 00:25:00,662
Excuse me, but if you already know,
why do you ask?

190
00:25:00,896 --> 00:25:05,787
- Waitress. Waitress!
- I am not a waitress, get it?

191
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,871
- Whisky!
- You got any money?

192
00:25:09,271 --> 00:25:12,537
First rule in Hell:
nothing's free.

193
00:25:12,854 --> 00:25:15,577
I'll bring it to you straight away.

194
00:25:16,435 --> 00:25:19,285
About what time will you be
expecting Mr. Harris back?

195
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:22,369
He's usually back by evening,
but I couldn't swear to it.

196
00:25:22,685 --> 00:25:26,360
And some crisps!
A bag of crisps

197
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,977
to line my stomach!

198
00:25:28,144 --> 00:25:31,119
Damned drunk. Alright, alright!

199
00:25:31,685 --> 00:25:35,827
I'll take him his rat poison,
then maybe he'll give me some peace.

200
00:25:37,394 --> 00:25:39,910
Lets see, where were we?

201
00:25:40,227 --> 00:25:44,033
Ah, yes, Harris. Do you want to
leave a message for him?

202
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:47,325
No, that's all right. I'll come back
some other time, thank you.

203
00:25:47,642 --> 00:25:48,808
Fair enough.

204
00:28:28,088 --> 00:28:29,305
"Hastings and Logan."

205
00:28:29,505 --> 00:28:30,888
I wasn't here on Thursday,

206
00:28:31,088 --> 00:28:32,938
but I can look it up
in the entrance book.

207
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:34,755
Lets see.

208
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,221
Thursday, Thursday...

209
00:28:38,421 --> 00:28:39,046
What?

210
00:28:39,213 --> 00:28:42,555
Sorry. It was Piet's shift,
the new boy.

211
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:45,438
And I'm afraid he must have
forgotten to write it down.

212
00:28:45,838 --> 00:28:48,305
All he's put down is
the name of the visitor.

213
00:28:48,505 --> 00:28:52,230
Yes, Toby Harris.
I know that already.

214
00:28:52,546 --> 00:28:56,228
Toby Harris? The same one
who used to work here?

215
00:28:56,794 --> 00:28:58,978
I thought he was still in jail.

216
00:28:59,294 --> 00:29:02,019
- ln jail?
- For murder.

217
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:06,019
It was before you were born,
must be more than twenty years ago.

218
00:29:06,336 --> 00:29:10,261
It was in all the papers.
I'll remember to ask Piet

219
00:29:10,461 --> 00:29:12,894
- who it was he came to see.
- Okay, thanks.

220
00:30:43,997 --> 00:30:46,170
Toby Harris, thirty-one years old,
resident in our city,

221
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:50,670
was arrested yesterday for
homicide in the first degree.

222
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,386
On the thirteenth of September

223
00:30:57,703 --> 00:31:00,636
Toby Harris hit his wife
and set their house on fire.

224
00:31:08,995 --> 00:31:10,886
Where is the missing baby?

225
00:32:15,197 --> 00:32:16,239
Hello?

226
00:32:18,405 --> 00:32:19,405
Hello?

227
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:24,089
- Daniella?
- Yes, speaking.

228
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:29,414
Daniella...
There's a present for you.

229
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,905
In reception.

230
00:32:31,655 --> 00:32:32,864
Who is this?

231
00:32:40,695 --> 00:32:43,420
Listen, I warn you, I'm not alone.

232
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,278
Silently night

233
00:32:48,195 --> 00:32:49,987
has come.

234
00:32:51,362 --> 00:32:53,153
Little old lights

235
00:32:53,778 --> 00:32:54,903
are stars.

236
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,670
Lazy, the moon arises.

237
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,960
Sleep quietly, sleep, my child.

238
00:33:31,358 --> 00:33:32,483
Hello, reception?

239
00:33:54,524 --> 00:33:58,372
Silently night has come.

240
00:34:00,897 --> 00:34:04,706
Little old lights are stars.

241
00:34:07,106 --> 00:34:11,164
Lazy, the moon arises.

242
00:34:19,147 --> 00:34:22,031
Sleep quietly, sleep,

243
00:34:22,231 --> 00:34:24,397
my child.

244
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,079
Fly through your land of dreams.

245
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,245
Sleep quietly, sleep, my child.

246
00:34:43,979 --> 00:34:48,995
Dogs will keep you safe.

247
00:34:50,187 --> 00:34:53,785
Birds will keep you warm.

248
00:34:56,268 --> 00:35:01,702
You deserve all the love the world

249
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:06,410
can give a child, my child.

250
00:35:08,685 --> 00:35:10,485
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

251
00:35:10,685 --> 00:35:14,993
pray for us sinners, now and at
the hour of our death. Amen.

252
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,985
Our Father who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come

253
00:35:18,185 --> 00:35:20,766
thy will be done,

254
00:35:20,933 --> 00:35:23,783
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

255
00:35:53,556 --> 00:35:57,656
- What the hell is this they've told me?
- The truth, Henry,

256
00:35:58,181 --> 00:35:59,489
nothing but the truth.

257
00:35:59,806 --> 00:36:02,989
This certainly is
a most extraordinary case.

258
00:36:03,848 --> 00:36:07,523
In all my years in this profession
I don't think I've ever seen

259
00:36:07,723 --> 00:36:11,156
anything so meticulous, so...

260
00:36:12,723 --> 00:36:14,806
just a moment.

261
00:36:15,429 --> 00:36:17,679
What's this here?

262
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:21,654
There's something written
on the skin.

263
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:24,971
It says...

264
00:36:26,137 --> 00:36:29,529
- My God!
- What is it? Tell me.

265
00:36:31,304 --> 00:36:34,904
It says, "Satan ordered me to do it".

266
00:36:36,012 --> 00:36:38,404
It's signed "Henry Potts".

267
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:42,594
Okay, very funny.

268
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:48,110
All day smelling this shit.

269
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,277
I can understand how you
ended up like this.

270
00:36:52,094 --> 00:36:54,819
One of these days you'll kill a nun

271
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,902
with an axe, you and
your monster here.

272
00:36:59,302 --> 00:37:02,194
You can prepare the body
for cremation now, Jedediah.

273
00:37:02,677 --> 00:37:06,944
Is that all you've got to tell me?
Or is there something worth hearing?

274
00:37:09,885 --> 00:37:12,092
Well, let's see.

275
00:37:17,092 --> 00:37:21,067
Logan's body was found in
a rubbish dump, kneeling down.

276
00:37:21,383 --> 00:37:23,942
A two-meter pole had been inserted
through his chest,

277
00:37:24,258 --> 00:37:28,442
from the 16th vertebrae,
emerging just below his sternum.

278
00:37:28,925 --> 00:37:31,358
His legs had been nailed
to the ground

279
00:37:31,675 --> 00:37:34,942
through the femoral muscles
by two wooden stakes.

280
00:37:35,675 --> 00:37:40,190
His hands had been tied together with
barbed wire, as if he'd been praying.

281
00:37:41,131 --> 00:37:45,065
- Why should anyone do that?
- lt looks to me like a ritual crime.

282
00:37:45,381 --> 00:37:48,856
- You know, devil worshipping.
- Demons and all that jazz?

283
00:37:49,506 --> 00:37:51,398
Now let me tell you my joke
for the day.

284
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,690
I have to go and explain all this
to the man's daughter.

285
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,815
I wouldn't worry about that
too much, Henry.

286
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,481
They've done that job for you.

287
00:38:03,173 --> 00:38:04,506
Satanic?

288
00:38:05,796 --> 00:38:09,729
Is that all you've discovered?
And you call yourselves police?

289
00:38:10,046 --> 00:38:14,271
- Miss Logan, I beg you...
- Don't beg me. Do something!

290
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:17,088
Here.

291
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:20,729
He's been following me for days,
photographing me.

292
00:38:21,296 --> 00:38:24,646
I'm sure he's the one who's been
calling me on the phone to scare me.

293
00:38:24,963 --> 00:38:28,063
He was with my father
the night before his suicide.

294
00:38:28,379 --> 00:38:30,938
- But how did you know...?
- He's a dangerous man.

295
00:38:31,254 --> 00:38:35,227
You can read it in those newspapers.
Question him.

296
00:38:36,169 --> 00:38:37,636
He stole my father's corpse.

297
00:38:37,836 --> 00:38:39,377
Find out why.

298
00:38:39,669 --> 00:38:43,602
And why has he been following me?
Here's his address.

299
00:38:44,711 --> 00:38:47,602
Miss Logan, everything is ready.

300
00:38:48,044 --> 00:38:50,894
I'll go and find Harris right away.

301
00:39:29,457 --> 00:39:30,373
Simon.

302
00:39:32,582 --> 00:39:35,390
I want to get to the bottom of this.

303
00:39:37,665 --> 00:39:40,598
I need to know
why he killed himself.

304
00:39:41,707 --> 00:39:44,098
And why is all this happening.

305
00:39:53,707 --> 00:39:55,913
Will you help me?

306
00:39:57,371 --> 00:39:59,538
Yes, I'll help you.

307
00:40:01,705 --> 00:40:03,955
Promise me.

308
00:40:04,996 --> 00:40:07,121
I promise.

309
00:41:54,572 --> 00:41:57,713
We must talk. I'll be
waiting for you at the Excelsior.

310
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:00,113
Padre Elias Dranig.

311
00:42:17,195 --> 00:42:19,378
You got here quickly.

312
00:42:19,695 --> 00:42:23,078
Toulouse, April, 1917,

313
00:42:23,278 --> 00:42:24,920
the middle of World War l.

314
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,911
And this other one took place
in Rome,

315
00:42:28,111 --> 00:42:30,878
in 1953, very near the Vatican.

316
00:42:32,695 --> 00:42:35,920
They were the only three cases
that were known up until today.

317
00:42:36,445 --> 00:42:40,668
This one, your father's, is the third.
I came as soon as I heard about it.

318
00:42:41,484 --> 00:42:44,501
Excuse me, a case of what?

319
00:42:45,734 --> 00:42:48,751
They were all victims
of ritual vengeance.

320
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,043
What are you talking about?

321
00:42:54,651 --> 00:42:55,901
The Abrahamites.

322
00:42:57,068 --> 00:43:00,418
They have existed
since Old Testament times.

323
00:43:05,276 --> 00:43:08,582
Sorry, but I find this
in very bad taste.

324
00:43:08,899 --> 00:43:12,624
My father, who had no reason
to commit suicide, shot himself.

325
00:43:12,941 --> 00:43:15,999
And I have not got time
for sick jokes like this.

326
00:43:16,899 --> 00:43:19,607
"Sleep my child."

327
00:43:22,274 --> 00:43:26,499
That's what the inscription at the
bottom of the tree means.

328
00:43:28,732 --> 00:43:30,416
So I see you've been to my house.

329
00:43:31,649 --> 00:43:34,624
Of course. How else could I have
left you my message?

330
00:43:37,064 --> 00:43:41,289
By the way, why there is only
one tree planted in your garden?

331
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:46,955
It was my parents' idea.
They planted it after I was born.

332
00:43:48,064 --> 00:43:50,872
The inscription goes back
to my mother's Russian origins.

333
00:43:51,647 --> 00:43:55,872
And it doesn't mean "sleep my child",
it means "once upon a time".

334
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:58,247
Your parents lied to you.

335
00:43:58,564 --> 00:44:01,872
That phrase is the beginning
of an Abrahamite prayer.

336
00:44:02,189 --> 00:44:04,270
Yes?

337
00:44:04,687 --> 00:44:07,870
Why would these Abrahamites
want to punish my father?

338
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:12,203
It's obvious. He disobeyed
one of their rules.

339
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:16,203
Are you suggesting that he was
one of them? You must be mad.

340
00:44:18,145 --> 00:44:21,328
I see my little vice has alarmed you.

341
00:44:22,645 --> 00:44:26,537
Do you recall what the Bible says
about healing the sick?

342
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:32,160
A syringe like this
can do a lot of harm,

343
00:44:33,101 --> 00:44:35,826
and also do a great deal of good.

344
00:44:36,726 --> 00:44:39,368
I am a poor diabetic,

345
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:43,785
who has a pathetic addiction
to insulin.

346
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:50,951
Miss Logan, are you a believer?

347
00:44:52,643 --> 00:44:55,568
Look, if you've got nothing
sensible you can tell me...

348
00:44:55,768 --> 00:44:58,699
There is something I would like you
to see with your own eyes.

349
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:00,391
What?

350
00:45:00,641 --> 00:45:04,741
The proof that what I have told you
is the truth.

351
00:45:06,308 --> 00:45:08,533
Do you know what this is?

352
00:45:08,849 --> 00:45:12,783
Abraham, about to sacrifice his son.

353
00:45:13,266 --> 00:45:16,699
And the Angel stopping him
in the nick of time.

354
00:45:17,224 --> 00:45:20,116
It's in the Bible.
Everybody knows the story.

355
00:45:20,433 --> 00:45:22,641
Look at it again.

356
00:45:23,516 --> 00:45:24,991
Look at it carefully.

357
00:45:26,847 --> 00:45:28,697
What is the Angel doing?

358
00:45:35,514 --> 00:45:38,572
He's restraining Abraham's hand.

359
00:45:39,181 --> 00:45:42,281
No, you are mistaken.

360
00:45:45,472 --> 00:45:48,656
Take a good look at his expression.

361
00:45:49,097 --> 00:45:51,989
Notice the position of his hand.

362
00:45:52,556 --> 00:45:56,612
What he is doing
is encouraging Abraham

363
00:45:57,179 --> 00:46:01,612
to tighten his grip
around lsaac's throat.

364
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:05,445
The true will of God.

365
00:46:06,554 --> 00:46:09,070
And the faith of the Abrahamites.

366
00:46:09,387 --> 00:46:13,612
The killing the first-born,
the great tribute to God,

367
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:18,362
who will reward the believers
and fill their house with joy,

368
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:22,985
after the sacrifice is complete.

369
00:46:32,802 --> 00:46:36,893
But the Bible says that God,
at the last moment, sent the Angel

370
00:46:37,093 --> 00:46:38,677
and saved lsaac.

371
00:46:39,093 --> 00:46:39,927
Yes,

372
00:46:40,635 --> 00:46:44,310
but it then says that Abraham came
down from the mountain alone.

373
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,318
There is no mention
of lsaac after that.

374
00:46:48,341 --> 00:46:51,816
The custom of sacrificing
the first-born

375
00:46:52,258 --> 00:46:56,441
was deeply and strongly rooted
amongst the ancient Hebrew people.

376
00:46:58,175 --> 00:47:02,358
In giving the story of lsaac a happy
ending the authors of the Bible

377
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:06,775
aimed to help eradicate
this ancient ritual.

378
00:47:08,466 --> 00:47:12,525
But the Abrahamites have kept it alive.
Even to this day.

379
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:17,273
They are convinced
that by killing their first-born

380
00:47:17,756 --> 00:47:20,356
they will secure God's favour.

381
00:47:21,131 --> 00:47:25,398
Don't forget that it was God himself
who sent his son

382
00:47:25,714 --> 00:47:28,423
to be sacrificed.

383
00:47:31,006 --> 00:47:33,189
Let's get this straight.

384
00:47:33,506 --> 00:47:36,981
According to you, my father
was a member of this group.

385
00:47:37,548 --> 00:47:41,606
I am his only child.
His first-born.

386
00:47:42,464 --> 00:47:45,021
Then, why am I alive?

387
00:47:49,837 --> 00:47:53,021
Did your father have a second name?

388
00:47:54,754 --> 00:47:58,937
When they are born, the first-born
of the Abrahamites

389
00:47:59,337 --> 00:48:01,937
are given the father's
second name.

390
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:05,396
Was your father's
second name Daniel?

391
00:48:06,379 --> 00:48:08,337
Was it Daniel?

392
00:48:18,669 --> 00:48:20,794
No.

393
00:48:23,835 --> 00:48:25,960
It was joseph.

394
00:48:26,377 --> 00:48:30,560
In that case his first-born should
have been called Joseph.

395
00:48:34,002 --> 00:48:38,269
- And and if it was a girl?
- She would have been called Josephine.

396
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:48,642
If they haven't got extravagant habits,
how can they be recognised?

397
00:48:49,583 --> 00:48:50,792
They can't.

398
00:48:51,792 --> 00:48:55,975
But there are a lot of them,
many more than you might think.

399
00:48:57,542 --> 00:49:00,517
It sounds, I don't know...

400
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:03,225
It sounds like something
out of the past.

401
00:49:03,542 --> 00:49:04,750
Every day,

402
00:49:05,292 --> 00:49:08,256
millions of human beings gather
together to drink the blood

403
00:49:08,456 --> 00:49:12,806
of a man who died
two thousand years ago.

404
00:49:14,623 --> 00:49:18,723
That also seems like something out
of the past, wouldn't you say?

405
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,848
But to strangle your own son!
My God!

406
00:49:24,373 --> 00:49:26,456
It's a fact.

407
00:49:26,873 --> 00:49:29,973
Moreover, on this particular point,

408
00:49:30,498 --> 00:49:34,679
the law of the Abrahamites
is clear and strict:

409
00:49:35,996 --> 00:49:40,263
only the hands of the father
can kill the first-born.

410
00:49:41,454 --> 00:49:43,888
Quite frankly, Father,

411
00:49:45,204 --> 00:49:48,429
I find this all very difficult
to believe.

412
00:49:50,163 --> 00:49:52,288
But...

413
00:49:53,913 --> 00:49:57,929
my mother has been in a psychiatric
hospital for years.

414
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,136
I went to visit her the other day,

415
00:50:03,286 --> 00:50:05,219
and she called me "Josephine".

416
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,094
She said it over and over again.

417
00:50:11,244 --> 00:50:13,369
"Josephine."

418
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:14,827
"Josephine."

419
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,611
Goodnight, princess.

420
00:51:58,736 --> 00:51:59,778
Calm down,

421
00:51:59,986 --> 00:52:01,069
relax.

422
00:52:02,403 --> 00:52:06,544
I've had this pain for days,
since my last examination.

423
00:52:07,236 --> 00:52:09,753
I thought it might be normal,
but now, with the bleeding...

424
00:52:10,069 --> 00:52:12,194
Relax.

425
00:52:12,611 --> 00:52:16,878
Now, I'm going to do a hysteroscopy
to examine the uterus.

426
00:52:22,026 --> 00:52:25,626
I'm afraid you might have
a endometrial polyp.

427
00:52:31,276 --> 00:52:35,334
The scab from the wound has come away
and there's some internal bleeding.

428
00:52:36,484 --> 00:52:38,667
It's perfectly normal.

429
00:52:38,984 --> 00:52:43,959
I'm going to try to stop the bleeding.
It may hurt.

430
00:52:47,607 --> 00:52:49,565
Doctor.

431
00:52:49,982 --> 00:52:52,207
I know this sounds silly.

432
00:52:52,899 --> 00:52:56,082
But, did my parents
ever have another daughter?

433
00:53:01,607 --> 00:53:03,690
Another daughter?

434
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:08,957
- Where did you get that idea?
- I know it seems absurd, but...

435
00:53:09,274 --> 00:53:12,415
Your parents and I have been friends
for as long as I can remember.

436
00:53:13,149 --> 00:53:15,705
If they'd had another daughter,

437
00:53:16,772 --> 00:53:19,705
I would've been the first to know,
don't you think?

438
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:23,080
Yes, the thought had occurred to me.

439
00:53:24,063 --> 00:53:25,980
Well, I'm done.

440
00:53:28,188 --> 00:53:29,872
There's nothing abnormal.

441
00:53:30,438 --> 00:53:33,072
I think it could all be
a result of the stress

442
00:53:33,272 --> 00:53:35,247
you've been under the last few days.

443
00:53:37,063 --> 00:53:39,205
Keep taking the tablets I prescribed.

444
00:53:39,522 --> 00:53:41,995
And if you have any more symptoms...

445
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:44,770
What about you?

446
00:53:45,936 --> 00:53:47,370
You've never had children?

447
00:53:51,936 --> 00:53:55,953
No. My wife and I never had children.

448
00:53:57,395 --> 00:53:59,870
The truth is, there was no time.

449
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,953
She left me before...

450
00:54:07,436 --> 00:54:11,576
Let's get you dressed and we'll make
an appointment for you next week.

451
00:54:46,807 --> 00:54:48,441
- Hello!
- Daniella,

452
00:54:48,641 --> 00:54:51,149
this is Simon.
I have had a visit from...

453
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:54,949
Hi, Simon. Do you know anyone
that can translate Russian?

454
00:54:55,349 --> 00:54:58,491
No, I don't think so.
Listen, Daniella. This is serious.

455
00:54:58,807 --> 00:55:02,741
I'm in your father's office
and lnspector Potts is here.

456
00:55:03,224 --> 00:55:04,780
He has been looking
for you all day.

457
00:55:05,055 --> 00:55:06,822
He has some news for you.

458
00:55:07,555 --> 00:55:12,072
About Toby Harris. Isn't he the man
who was in jail?

459
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:13,639
Yes, that's the man.

460
00:55:13,847 --> 00:55:15,655
He worked for you years ago.

461
00:55:16,014 --> 00:55:19,697
- And he's mixed up in all this.
- Yes, he wants to talk about that.

462
00:55:20,847 --> 00:55:23,197
I think you'd better come right away.

463
00:55:34,137 --> 00:55:36,387
jesus.

464
00:55:46,137 --> 00:55:48,987
It's no wonder that the girl is crazy.

465
00:55:52,553 --> 00:55:56,195
Miss Logan. How good of you
to come so quickly!

466
00:55:56,887 --> 00:55:59,401
Has Harris confessed that
he's been following me?

467
00:56:01,218 --> 00:56:03,526
Why did he steal my father's corpse?

468
00:56:03,843 --> 00:56:06,176
Harris?

469
00:56:06,968 --> 00:56:10,610
Isn't that the man we picked up
following a complaint from you?

470
00:56:10,926 --> 00:56:11,635
What do you mean?

471
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:16,443
The psychopath that's going around
opening graves. The monster!

472
00:56:17,301 --> 00:56:19,385
Listen to me.

473
00:56:19,801 --> 00:56:22,101
Since he came back to this town,

474
00:56:22,301 --> 00:56:25,393
Toby Harris has been working
in the municipal dog pound.

475
00:56:25,593 --> 00:56:28,391
That's where he was the night
they stole your father's corpse,

476
00:56:28,591 --> 00:56:31,141
busy gassing stray dogs.

477
00:56:31,341 --> 00:56:33,391
In other words, he has an alibi.

478
00:56:33,591 --> 00:56:37,349
But what about he photos I gave you?
They prove he's been following me!

479
00:56:37,549 --> 00:56:41,941
You gave me those photos.
There's no proof Harris took them.

480
00:56:42,549 --> 00:56:43,974
Are you calling me a liar?

481
00:56:44,174 --> 00:56:48,566
You might like to know, Mr. Harris
has information that will interest you.

482
00:56:48,883 --> 00:56:51,274
Information he wants to
give to you personally.

483
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:56,764
- You didn't try to worm it out of him?
- Me? What right have I got to do that?

484
00:56:56,964 --> 00:56:59,147
He's already paid his debt to society.

485
00:56:59,464 --> 00:57:02,814
This is incredible, you're on his side.
You're a...

486
00:57:03,131 --> 00:57:07,022
Before you say something serious,
just listen to me.

487
00:57:07,339 --> 00:57:10,264
The only one who's done
something illegal is you,

488
00:57:10,464 --> 00:57:12,472
breaking into Harris' room
the way you did.

489
00:57:12,672 --> 00:57:14,131
I could arrest you.

490
00:57:14,547 --> 00:57:17,647
Now, tell me, what am l?

491
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:39,879
Toby Harris?

492
00:57:46,879 --> 00:57:47,795
Toby Harris!

493
00:58:07,668 --> 00:58:11,268
Inspector Potts says you have
something to tell to me.

494
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:13,960
What is it?

495
00:58:15,668 --> 00:58:18,100
Speak to me God damn it!

496
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:24,933
What can you tell me
about my father's death?

497
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:28,433
That he deserved it.
But I had nothing to do with it.

498
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:33,600
You were with him at the
boarding house. Why did he go to see you?

499
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,300
Because I asked him to come.

500
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:38,766
- To do what?
- Nothing, I've done nothing.

501
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:42,641
Oh no? You killed your wife.

502
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:47,014
Somehow you're tied to my father's death.
You worked for him, I know that.

503
00:58:47,331 --> 00:58:51,348
And that song?
Why did you send it to me?

504
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:01,598
It's a song that I sang you
when you were a baby.

505
00:59:10,164 --> 00:59:13,637
Years ago I had a good job.

506
00:59:14,662 --> 00:59:18,929
But I got heavily into debt,
and on top of that my wife drank.

507
00:59:22,037 --> 00:59:25,637
Things got a little better
when she was pregnant.

508
00:59:26,246 --> 00:59:30,262
But after the baby was born
she started drinking again.

509
00:59:33,204 --> 00:59:35,329
One night,

510
00:59:35,871 --> 00:59:38,887
the 13th of September, 1976,

511
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,719
I came home from work late.

512
00:59:43,285 --> 00:59:47,552
She was euphoric,
completely out of her mind.

513
00:59:48,994 --> 00:59:52,344
She was waving banknotes
in my face.

514
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:55,619
A lot of money.

515
00:59:57,452 --> 01:00:00,385
But my baby had disappeared.

516
01:00:04,744 --> 01:00:06,119
She had sold her.

517
01:00:07,867 --> 01:00:10,967
We struggled. I hit her.

518
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:14,675
Then all of a sudden
I saw smoke and fire.

519
01:00:14,992 --> 01:00:18,758
I don't know, I think the curtain
must have caught on the gas ring.

520
01:00:19,075 --> 01:00:22,175
The whole house
just went up so fast.

521
01:00:23,033 --> 01:00:27,217
I tried to save her, I swear to God
I tried, just look at my face!

522
01:00:27,992 --> 01:00:30,217
I couldn't do anything!

523
01:00:30,825 --> 01:00:34,798
Harris, when you're finished, come to
my house and clean up my dog's shit.

524
01:00:45,156 --> 01:00:46,798
What happened to the baby?

525
01:00:52,781 --> 01:00:55,548
She's still with the people
who bought her.

526
01:00:56,365 --> 01:01:00,631
Millionaire couple. The woman couldn't
have children, they told my wife.

527
01:01:02,571 --> 01:01:05,629
Do you know what
your cellmates do to you

528
01:01:05,946 --> 01:01:08,321
if you've hurt kids?

529
01:01:09,821 --> 01:01:11,246
For only I knew the truth,

530
01:01:11,446 --> 01:01:15,754
that my baby was alive, in the hands
of that fucking rich couple.

531
01:01:16,071 --> 01:01:19,796
Theodore Logan
and his wife, Nana.

532
01:01:21,863 --> 01:01:23,254
You are my little girl.

533
01:01:25,029 --> 01:01:27,338
You're the baby they stole from me.

534
01:01:27,654 --> 01:01:31,086
You're crazy! I was born later,

535
01:01:31,694 --> 01:01:35,286
- a year after that.
- It's a lie. They told you that

536
01:01:35,486 --> 01:01:37,202
in case I came back.
Nana couldn't have children.

537
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:41,419
That's ridiculous. Nana is my mother.
She gave birth to me.

538
01:01:41,736 --> 01:01:45,252
More lies! I can prove it to you.
Look!

539
01:01:46,944 --> 01:01:51,669
This is the brooch Nana was wearing
on the 13th of September, 1976.

540
01:01:52,194 --> 01:01:54,419
The night they bought you.

541
01:01:55,194 --> 01:01:56,711
I've never seen it before.

542
01:01:58,442 --> 01:01:59,442
Of course not.

543
01:02:00,525 --> 01:02:02,834
How could you remember?

544
01:02:05,025 --> 01:02:07,667
My wife took a fancy to it

545
01:02:08,442 --> 01:02:11,542
and demanded it
as part of the payment.

546
01:02:13,942 --> 01:02:16,109
Here, you have it.

547
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,250
It's my legacy to you:

548
01:02:25,398 --> 01:02:26,398
the truth.

549
01:02:29,898 --> 01:02:32,582
Your whole life has been a lie.

550
01:02:35,232 --> 01:02:39,207
Except I am your father
and I do love you.

551
01:02:44,523 --> 01:02:46,790
Search through your past.

552
01:02:47,523 --> 01:02:49,832
Search for the truth.

553
01:04:30,765 --> 01:04:32,849
Mum.

554
01:04:33,265 --> 01:04:35,349
I need your help.

555
01:04:37,765 --> 01:04:40,657
I need to know the truth
about my life.

556
01:04:46,013 --> 01:04:48,238
What does it say here?

557
01:04:55,138 --> 01:04:57,613
It is the beginning of
a Russian story, isn't it?

558
01:05:01,513 --> 01:05:04,113
You told it to me
when I was a little girl.

559
01:05:07,805 --> 01:05:10,095
Who am I really?

560
01:05:14,053 --> 01:05:16,945
What happened on the 13th
of September, 1976?

561
01:05:38,593 --> 01:05:42,734
I've got what you wanted to look at.
Could you come with me, please?

562
01:06:04,634 --> 01:06:09,441
Here it is. Christmas, 1976.
Three months after...

563
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:14,024
- After what?
- Do you know about her life in Russia?

564
01:06:14,507 --> 01:06:18,607
No, her medical history's incomplete.
We know nothing about that period.

565
01:06:18,924 --> 01:06:23,149
Doctor, this is a ridiculous, but...
Was my mother sterile?

566
01:06:24,882 --> 01:06:28,816
I don't know what you mean,
a problem with the birth?

567
01:06:29,132 --> 01:06:33,397
No, no, if she was sterile
before I was born.

568
01:06:35,005 --> 01:06:36,172
Doctor!

569
01:06:37,297 --> 01:06:39,505
Doctor!

570
01:06:47,672 --> 01:06:51,714
Nurse, quick, quick.

571
01:06:52,839 --> 01:06:56,647
- She's lost a lot of blood.
- The bleeding won't stop.

572
01:08:18,916 --> 01:08:21,166
Where am l?

573
01:08:21,749 --> 01:08:23,872
What's happened?

574
01:08:31,247 --> 01:08:34,472
You fainted.
In your mother's room.

575
01:08:47,872 --> 01:08:50,745
I'm terribly sorry.

576
01:08:58,704 --> 01:09:01,179
I know this isn't the right moment,

577
01:09:01,495 --> 01:09:06,637
but while you were unconscious,
we found something untoward.

578
01:09:08,079 --> 01:09:11,512
Have you visited
your gynaecologist recently?

579
01:09:13,537 --> 01:09:16,429
I'm having some tests done now.

580
01:09:17,245 --> 01:09:21,093
Good, good. I'm relieved to hear it.

581
01:09:21,785 --> 01:09:25,177
But could you tell your doctor to
control the bleeding you're having?

582
01:09:25,493 --> 01:09:30,385
Now, I'm not an expert, but I think
you have a fairly major infection.

583
01:09:31,702 --> 01:09:34,160
When can I go home?

584
01:09:35,077 --> 01:09:38,177
I'm keeping you in
for a couple of days.

585
01:09:42,118 --> 01:09:44,427
The rest will do you good.

586
01:10:05,658 --> 01:10:09,925
There's nothing like smoking a cigar
stolen from a dying person.

587
01:10:11,366 --> 01:10:13,923
Ain't that right, you old hag?

588
01:10:16,989 --> 01:10:19,214
Resting a bit, Daniella?

589
01:10:20,989 --> 01:10:24,423
As soon as I finish with the rest of
the patients I'll bring you your pills.

590
01:10:25,031 --> 01:10:29,298
- Pills?
- Sedatives. To make you sleep better.

591
01:10:31,531 --> 01:10:32,656
"Sleep my child."

592
01:10:40,404 --> 01:10:44,671
If you don't want your pills
I'll buy them from you...

593
01:10:49,071 --> 01:10:51,237
with flies.

594
01:10:55,112 --> 01:10:58,296
Sedatives, four flies.

595
01:11:00,112 --> 01:11:02,279
Stimulants,

596
01:11:03,112 --> 01:11:05,821
five beetles.

597
01:11:12,069 --> 01:11:14,277
Five.

598
01:11:24,777 --> 01:11:29,044
Do you hear? Five!
Nobody will give you more.

599
01:11:40,150 --> 01:11:42,275
That's pretty.

600
01:11:43,525 --> 01:11:45,817
"Sleep my child."

601
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:50,875
Is that what it means?

602
01:11:51,108 --> 01:11:54,833
Watch out for the hag.
She stole your photos.

603
01:11:57,900 --> 01:12:01,708
- Did you copy it from the photo?
- Six is my last offer.

604
01:12:02,025 --> 01:12:04,106
It's written here.

605
01:12:04,523 --> 01:12:08,790
Take your sedatives and you'll sleep
like a log until tomorrow.

606
01:12:11,731 --> 01:12:16,123
This lady, can she speak Russian?
Can she read it?

607
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:17,998
Oh, yes. She was born there.

608
01:12:18,273 --> 01:12:22,540
She's a very nice lady, very quiet.
Not like that other patient.

609
01:12:23,023 --> 01:12:25,290
Come on, take your pills.

610
01:12:33,188 --> 01:12:35,371
You have a good rest.

611
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,242
Fucking Doctor Grant.
He takes our marmalade away.

612
01:13:32,559 --> 01:13:36,242
I've heard he's going to
take away our vanilla ice cream.

613
01:13:37,184 --> 01:13:39,909
And our chocolate ice cream too.
Fucking Doctor Grant!

614
01:13:40,184 --> 01:13:41,609
Fucking Doctor Grant!

615
01:13:41,809 --> 01:13:45,242
- But you, you are our saviour.
- Saviour?

616
01:13:45,934 --> 01:13:48,575
- I am the saviour?
- Yes, you.

617
01:13:48,934 --> 01:13:52,775
Bring us back our ice cream. Save us!
Go on, go tell the others.

618
01:13:52,975 --> 01:13:56,365
Fucking Doctor Grant! He thinks
he can take away our ice cream away.

619
01:13:56,682 --> 01:14:01,073
But I am the Saviour!

620
01:14:01,473 --> 01:14:04,490
- What are you doing, Johnny?
- Fucking Doctor Grant!

621
01:14:05,807 --> 01:14:08,740
I am the saviour of mankind!

622
01:14:10,932 --> 01:14:13,265
Back to bed, fast.

623
01:14:13,765 --> 01:14:16,073
Fucking Doctor Grant!

624
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:47,149
Daniella, look at the camera, love.

625
01:15:49,757 --> 01:15:54,399
Wave to Daddy.
No, look, Mummy's got the camera.

626
01:15:56,132 --> 01:15:58,674
Hotel Excelsior?

627
01:15:59,215 --> 01:16:01,590
Father Elias Dranig.

628
01:16:17,963 --> 01:16:20,213
Go on, smile.

629
01:16:43,128 --> 01:16:44,420
Okay. Thanks.

630
01:16:45,461 --> 01:16:46,378
Shit!

631
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:52,270
Today's your birthday, you're 8,
a year for every rose in this bunch.

632
01:16:53,586 --> 01:16:55,061
I can't be there with you,

633
01:16:55,378 --> 01:16:59,103
but someone will see that you
get this at the right time.

634
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:01,936
Inside you will find your present.

635
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:05,645
As always.
Always, wherever I may be,

636
01:17:06,668 --> 01:17:07,834
happy birthday...

637
01:17:26,709 --> 01:17:30,309
Miss Logan, there's a parcel for you.
They brought it this week.

638
01:17:32,834 --> 01:17:35,182
It's a big bunch of roses.

639
01:17:36,166 --> 01:17:38,516
Happy birthday, by the way.

640
01:17:44,041 --> 01:17:46,849
Miss Logan, are you all right?

641
01:17:48,124 --> 01:17:49,332
Better than ever.

642
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:51,891
If you need anything...

643
01:17:55,457 --> 01:17:59,641
Raymond, They just called
and said Chrysteen...

644
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:05,080
Are you all right?

645
01:18:06,914 --> 01:18:09,122
No.

646
01:18:11,497 --> 01:18:13,580
It's only natural.

647
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:16,514
Don't worry about it.

648
01:18:19,789 --> 01:18:22,222
I'm going to be there with you.

649
01:18:26,539 --> 01:18:29,970
Get your car and meet me
at the door.

650
01:18:38,245 --> 01:18:41,553
I can almost feel your presence
here, with me,

651
01:18:42,412 --> 01:18:45,178
as I make this terrible decision.

652
01:18:47,287 --> 01:18:49,803
I know it's hard to accept,

653
01:18:50,370 --> 01:18:52,845
maybe even incredible.

654
01:18:53,912 --> 01:18:57,301
But the crimes we commit finally
catch up with us.

655
01:18:57,785 --> 01:18:59,868
The past.

656
01:19:00,868 --> 01:19:04,385
That ugly monster, the past.

657
01:19:06,826 --> 01:19:10,885
It all started on the 13th
of September, 1976.

658
01:19:11,826 --> 01:19:16,051
Your mother was about to give birth.
She was so happy.

659
01:19:17,493 --> 01:19:19,760
But we both knew only too well

660
01:19:20,076 --> 01:19:23,135
what our religious beliefs
would oblige us to do.

661
01:19:24,574 --> 01:19:27,133
The baby that lived in her womb

662
01:19:27,449 --> 01:19:31,341
was to be born only to be
strangled by its father.

663
01:19:32,366 --> 01:19:33,658
Strangled by me.

664
01:19:35,824 --> 01:19:40,091
Only a few days before the baby
was due to be born,

665
01:19:41,491 --> 01:19:43,716
your mother lost the baby,
a girl we had named Josephine.

666
01:19:44,824 --> 01:19:48,374
This terrible grief was aggravated
by our anguish

667
01:19:48,574 --> 01:19:49,866
about the future.

668
01:19:52,031 --> 01:19:55,797
Our next baby would also
have to be killed.

669
01:19:56,656 --> 01:19:59,214
Your mother couldn't handle that.

670
01:19:59,572 --> 01:20:02,381
It was she who remembered that
an employee at our lab

671
01:20:02,697 --> 01:20:05,547
a simple man, a poor man

672
01:20:06,197 --> 01:20:08,756
and his wife had just had
a baby girl.

673
01:20:10,489 --> 01:20:12,714
She sold us her baby,

674
01:20:13,447 --> 01:20:15,289
so I had a baby to kill

675
01:20:15,489 --> 01:20:17,756
in front of my fellow Abrahamites.

676
01:20:19,570 --> 01:20:22,462
That's the kind
of man your father is.

677
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:26,837
A traitor to his beliefs,
a murderer of children.

678
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:32,795
Your mother began suffering
from deep depression.

679
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:38,462
I was weighed down with
guilt and grief.

680
01:20:40,112 --> 01:20:43,170
I only stayed alive for you,

681
01:20:44,695 --> 01:20:48,460
my loved one,
light of my life.

682
01:20:51,652 --> 01:20:54,043
Everything would've ended like that,

683
01:20:54,860 --> 01:20:58,877
except the man Harris came back
in search of his daughter.

684
01:20:59,902 --> 01:21:04,127
He couldn 't imagine that she died
25 years ago, sacrificed by me.

685
01:21:05,943 --> 01:21:09,585
He thinks you are his baby girl.

686
01:21:10,818 --> 01:21:13,460
However, because of his insistence,

687
01:21:13,775 --> 01:21:18,375
my fellow Abrahamites found out
what really happened in 1976.

688
01:21:20,316 --> 01:21:24,125
And they now demand that I do
what I had not done then:

689
01:21:24,441 --> 01:21:26,708
kill my first-born. You.

690
01:21:28,608 --> 01:21:31,833
If I am dead, you are safe.

691
01:21:32,275 --> 01:21:34,791
If I am dead, you live.

692
01:21:36,441 --> 01:21:40,208
So this is my birthday gift
to you: life.

693
01:21:41,356 --> 01:21:44,706
Happy birthday, little Deedee.
I love you.

694
01:21:46,189 --> 01:21:48,623
I will always love you.

695
01:22:05,731 --> 01:22:09,871
john told me you wanted to know who
Toby Harris came to see the other day.

696
01:22:10,187 --> 01:22:12,946
- lt doesn't matter now.
- He made a great scene.

697
01:22:13,146 --> 01:22:15,737
He was screaming and shouting.
He was in a real state.

698
01:22:15,937 --> 01:22:20,654
They had to call me to throw him out.
Even my boss congratulated me.

699
01:22:20,854 --> 01:22:25,537
- My father was good to his employees.
- lt wasn't your father, Miss Logan.

700
01:22:27,312 --> 01:22:29,571
- Wasn't it?
- No, Miss. It was Mr. Hastings

701
01:22:29,771 --> 01:22:33,287
who had the argument with Harris.
They both looked very angry.

702
01:22:33,896 --> 01:22:38,119
Throwing Harris out was my first
real action, out of the academy, I mean.

703
01:22:55,435 --> 01:22:57,560
Chrysteen.

704
01:23:36,431 --> 01:23:37,223
Daniella.

705
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:43,406
- I've come to see...
- Chrysteen, I suppose.

706
01:23:44,473 --> 01:23:47,115
Has the baby been born yet?

707
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:51,656
Gabriel? His father's
with him right now.

708
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:56,306
Come in.

709
01:23:57,598 --> 01:23:58,223
Come in.

710
01:24:08,929 --> 01:24:12,404
Daniella has been kind enough
to come and see Chrysteen.

711
01:24:12,888 --> 01:24:13,929
Where is she?

712
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:22,029
I want to see the baby.

713
01:24:32,344 --> 01:24:35,861
- It's not the best of times.
- Nonetheless, I insist.

714
01:24:37,469 --> 01:24:40,319
Simon, I must warn you.

715
01:24:41,177 --> 01:24:43,427
I know everything.

716
01:24:45,177 --> 01:24:47,527
My dear, what are you talking about?

717
01:24:48,469 --> 01:24:50,861
I know you know Harris.

718
01:24:51,177 --> 01:24:54,400
I know you are responsible
for my father's death.

719
01:24:54,967 --> 01:24:58,484
That you ordered somebody
to steal his dead body.

720
01:24:59,259 --> 01:25:02,942
And I know what all of you
are going to do to Chrysteen's son.

721
01:25:05,009 --> 01:25:07,025
It was my father who told me.

722
01:25:08,467 --> 01:25:12,234
He explained everything
and I have proof.

723
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,692
You didn't expect that, did you?

724
01:25:18,259 --> 01:25:21,359
No, I must admit I didn't.

725
01:25:26,590 --> 01:25:28,882
My dear,

726
01:25:30,215 --> 01:25:33,190
all this can still be sorted out.

727
01:25:35,673 --> 01:25:37,965
Go home and rest.

728
01:25:38,798 --> 01:25:40,065
If I'm going anywhere,...

729
01:25:43,673 --> 01:25:45,798
it's to the police.

730
01:25:46,215 --> 01:25:50,730
You don't know what you're saying.
Your illness is affecting you.

731
01:25:51,213 --> 01:25:53,505
My illness?

732
01:25:54,588 --> 01:25:56,755
What illness?

733
01:25:58,546 --> 01:26:01,480
What illness is he talking about?

734
01:26:02,338 --> 01:26:03,421
Tell her, Doctor.

735
01:26:09,088 --> 01:26:11,063
Through the fault
of your father,

736
01:26:11,921 --> 01:26:14,605
you are a branch that
should have never sprouted.

737
01:26:17,169 --> 01:26:21,311
Dr. Larabee had no other choice
than to sterilise you.

738
01:26:22,586 --> 01:26:26,061
This has been painful
for him and for me.

739
01:26:26,961 --> 01:26:29,253
But necessary.

740
01:26:34,544 --> 01:26:36,936
You are an insult to God.

741
01:26:39,794 --> 01:26:41,919
You're crazy.

742
01:26:43,211 --> 01:26:45,376
You're all crazy!

743
01:26:46,917 --> 01:26:51,184
Mrs. Hastings, you've been a mother.
You are a mother.

744
01:26:51,667 --> 01:26:54,767
How can you stand for
this monstrosity?

745
01:27:04,167 --> 01:27:05,126
Daniella.

746
01:27:05,876 --> 01:27:08,851
If you go upstairs there will be
no turning back.

747
01:27:11,832 --> 01:27:14,724
You will have to
face the consequences.

748
01:29:08,116 --> 01:29:09,241
Calm down.

749
01:29:43,905 --> 01:29:45,364
You killed my son.

750
01:30:13,487 --> 01:30:14,570
I'm sorry.

751
01:30:42,235 --> 01:30:44,651
Calm down.

752
01:30:46,985 --> 01:30:49,835
When you wake
you'll see things different.

753
01:30:52,941 --> 01:30:55,708
- Well?
- There's no question about it.

754
01:30:56,566 --> 01:30:57,858
He was strangled.

755
01:30:58,858 --> 01:31:02,874
God Almighty. Killing the son
of her best friend.

756
01:31:04,649 --> 01:31:07,333
Maybe the envy drove her crazy.

757
01:31:09,774 --> 01:31:12,249
She was sterile, wasn't she?

758
01:31:12,566 --> 01:31:16,833
Her mental disorder is much
more serious than plain envy.

759
01:31:17,733 --> 01:31:19,416
What will happen to her now?

760
01:31:20,856 --> 01:31:21,981
Who knows?

761
01:31:23,564 --> 01:31:27,539
She still hasn't recovered from
her nervous fit Hastings' house

762
01:31:27,856 --> 01:31:30,206
after killing the baby.

763
01:31:31,314 --> 01:31:34,081
Maybe she never will recover.

764
01:31:35,147 --> 01:31:37,914
Might be better for her if she didn't.

765
01:31:47,437 --> 01:31:48,687
I feel like a drink.

766
01:31:49,812 --> 01:31:51,020
Want to join me?

767
01:31:52,895 --> 01:31:54,104
Thanks Henry,

768
01:31:55,479 --> 01:31:58,495
but I have some work
that I still need to do.

769
01:32:25,268 --> 01:32:31,243
Silently night has come.

770
01:32:35,018 --> 01:32:38,977
Little lights

771
01:32:39,185 --> 01:32:42,060
are stars.

772
01:32:46,475 --> 01:32:50,575
Lazy, the moon arises.

773
01:33:01,016 --> 01:33:04,650
You've got a visitor.
Your father's come to see you.

774
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:10,489
Sleep quietly, sleep, my child.

775
01:33:14,473 --> 01:33:18,223
Fly to the land

776
01:33:18,556 --> 01:33:21,723
of dreams.

777
01:33:24,348 --> 01:33:28,148
Sleep quietly, sleep,

778
01:33:28,348 --> 01:33:31,639
my child.

779
01:33:44,054 --> 01:33:48,096
Dogs will keep you

780
01:33:48,346 --> 01:33:50,887
safe.

781
01:33:53,929 --> 01:33:58,096
Birds will keep you

782
01:33:58,721 --> 01:34:01,096
warm.

783
01:34:04,387 --> 01:34:10,152
You deserve all the love

784
01:34:10,427 --> 01:34:12,594
the world

785
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:17,010
can give a child.

786
01:34:17,844 --> 01:34:20,885
My child.

787
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:25,219
Sleep,

788
01:34:26,427 --> 01:34:27,927
quietly sleep,

789
01:34:30,177 --> 01:34:31,219
my child.

790
01:34:35,092 --> 01:34:37,175
Fly to land

791
01:34:38,258 --> 01:34:39,592
of dreams.

792
01:34:44,717 --> 01:34:45,842
Sleep quietly,

793
01:34:46,008 --> 01:34:48,467
sleep, my child.
